# Python readiness checklist

This checklist records the shipped Python preview and tracks the remaining work
toward a stable, broadly supported WinRT projection. The `dynwinrt` runtime and
standalone `dynwinrt-codegen` command are published on PyPI.

See [`docs/guides/python/python-ui-ecosystem.md`](../guides/python/python-ui-ecosystem.md) for research on
Python UI frameworks, static pywinrt adoption, real integrations, and the value
of a dynamic projection.

## Target states

- **Data API preview (shipped):** a clean machine can install wheels and generated
  bindings, then call supported Windows SDK APIs without Rust, Node.js, or a
  source checkout.
- **Data API release (in progress):** generated APIs follow normal Python semantics for
  typing, async, events, collections, errors, and lifecycle.
- **WinUI preview (x64 validated):** Python can bootstrap the Windows App SDK,
  enter an STA, construct composable WinUI classes, and load Fluent resources.
  Native ARM64 immediate teardown remains tracked in
  [issue #116](https://github.com/microsoft/dynwinrt/issues/116).

## Verified baseline

- [x] The PyO3 runtime builds on Windows ARM64.
- [x] Generated `Windows.Foundation.Uri` bindings import and call real WinRT
      APIs on ARM64.
- [x] Python generation emits `.py` implementations.
- [x] `--lang py` emits `.pyi`, `__init__.pyi`, and `py.typed` by default.
- [x] Generated Python E2E covers 42 API specs and 88 checks.
- [x] Runtime primitives exist for arrays, structs, delegates, events,
      cancellation, progress callbacks, vectors, and maps.
- [x] Python codegen snapshots cover the `Uri` implementation and stubs.

## P0: generated package correctness

- [x] Replace eager cross-module runtime imports with cycle-safe lazy
      resolution.
- [x] Keep referenced types visible to static type checkers through
      `TYPE_CHECKING` imports.
- [x] Model WinRT runtime-class and interface compatibility structurally in
      input annotations without changing runtime inheritance.
- [x] Add an import regression for a real cyclic graph such as
      `Windows.Data.Xml.Dom.XmlDocument`.
- [x] Preserve `Uri` implementation and `.pyi` snapshots.
- [x] Organize output by WinRT namespace instead of one flat short-name
      namespace.
- [x] Derive Python symbols, implementation modules, facade modules, and stable
      path hashes from a namespace- and kind-preserving semantic type identity,
      including recursively closed generic arguments.
- [x] Keep same-short-name types available through their namespace facades,
      omit ambiguous root exports, and use deterministic qualified aliases in
      consumer modules instead of selecting a short-name ABI implicitly.
- [x] Pass an immutable Python projection context through generation and
      rendering instead of installing thread-local module-layout state.
- [x] Detect and reject namespace/type filename collisions.
- [x] Add stage/swap generation and remove stale Python output.
- [x] Emit a consumable Python package manifest with an exact runtime
      dependency.
- [x] Emit one canonical module and Python class per WinRT struct instead of
      duplicating incompatible struct classes in every consumer module.
- [x] Make root and namespace exports lazy, keep ABI helpers in type-specific
      facades, and expose only Python types from public package indexes.

## P0: runtime and generated API agreement

- [x] Ship a `.pyi` and `py.typed` marker for the `dynwinrt` extension.
- [x] Return declared enum members as generated `IntEnum` instances while
      preserving unknown values as integers.
- [x] Use `invoke_all()` for arbitrary multiple-out methods.
- [x] Add Python E2E for `IVector.IndexOf` and other multiple-out methods.

      consistently in runtime code and stubs.
- [x] Project `IReference<T>` struct fields as native `T | None` on reads while
      accepting native values, `None`, and legacy wrappers on writes.
- [x] Preserve the full `UInt32` / `UInt64` range when converting to Python
      integers.
- [x] Make Python stubs part of E2E and run a static type checker.
- [x] Make `.pyi` generation the default for `--lang py`.
- [x] Pass full-package `mypy --strict`, including collection overrides and
      cross-module struct arguments.

## P0: async semantics

- [x] Return a Python awaitable instead of blocking inside generated async
      methods.
- [x] Integrate WinRT completion with an `asyncio` event loop.

## P0: CI and distribution

- [x] Execute all tests under `bindings/py/tests` in CI.
- [x] Build and install wheels before running Python E2E.
- [x] Complete the first live CPython 3.11–3.14 x64/ARM64 release-matrix run.
      Native ARM64 builds and isolated consumers run on GitHub-hosted Windows
      ARM64 runners.
- [x] Remove unverified PyPy metadata.
- [x] Derive Python artifact versions from ordinary `v<version>` release tags,
      inject them only into ephemeral CI workspaces, and attach the complete
      wheel set to the shared JavaScript GitHub release.
- [ ] Publish signed/provenanced wheels to an approved internal Python feed.
- [x] Route production PyPI publication through the official 1ES ADO release
      pipeline and Microsoft ESRP identity. `PublishPyPI` is enabled by default
      for tag releases and can be disabled for non-PyPI rehearsals.
- [x] Complete one-time ESRP/PyPI onboarding for `dynwinrt` and
      `dynwinrt-codegen`, including release owners and approvers.
- [x] Add complete tested Python wheel assets and installation notes to GitHub
      releases.
- [x] Provide a Python-native codegen CLI wheel using maturin binary bindings.
- [x] Add clean, isolated wheel consumers that import/call stock WinRT and run
      codegen with Cargo/Rust unavailable.

## P1: Python-native behavior

- [x] Map HRESULT failures to `OSError` with a stable `.winerror`.

- [x] Surface Python callback failures instead of returning unconditional
      success to WinRT.

      projected Python values.
- [x] Implement Python collection protocols for iterable, vector, and map
      projections.

      timedeltas where the WinRT signature permits them.
- [x] Emit `IntFlag` for flags enums.
- [x] Add overload-aware runtime dispatch and `typing.overload` stubs.
- [x] Generate idiomatic constructors such as `Uri(...)` while retaining an
      internal wrapper path for returned native objects.
- [x] Expose `project_as(value, Type)` for typed, non-consuming projection of
      raw `Object`/`IInspectable` values to RuntimeClasses, matching JavaScript
      `projectAs`; use `as_interface()` / interface `from_value()` for QI views.
- [x] Declare non-suppressing runtime and generated context managers as
      `Literal[False]`.
- [x] Replace deprecated PyO3 automatic `FromPyObject` behavior explicitly.
- [x] Document COM apartment ownership and provide a balanced context manager.

## P1: tooling and documentation

- [ ] Add a Python configuration surface to winapp CLI or a dedicated Python
      orchestration command.
- [x] Generate package names and imports consistently across Windows SDK,
      Windows App SDK, and custom WinMD namespaces.
- [x] Add runnable samples for files, notifications, imaging, async, events,
      collections, and custom WinMD consumption.
- [x] Document generated-code version compatibility with `dynwinrt`.
- [ ] Add troubleshooting for metadata, apartment, bootstrap, architecture,
      and wheel compatibility failures.
- [x] Add progress-callback tests for worker-thread delivery and operations
      that complete concurrently with callback registration.

## WinUI milestone

- [x] Project public composable `__init__` overloads without requiring the
      ABI-only `outer` parameter. The low-level factory method remains available
      for parity and still exposes its raw ABI shape.
- [x] Keep protected composable constructors out of generated Python
      `__init__` overloads.
- [x] Make WinMD activation/composition metadata the constructor boundary:
      system-returned and protected-composition classes retain native wrapping
      but reject public construction and expose no constructible `.pyi` overload.
- [x] Add a reusable outer/inner aggregation host for public composable Python
      subclasses, preserving controlling COM identity and inner ownership.
- [x] Add metadata-driven local overridable-interface vtables for public
      composable subclasses, including native-invoked FrameworkElement
      measure/arrange/template callbacks and fail-closed ABI validation.
- [x] Register arbitrary Python runtime-class names and compose them into the
      XAML metadata-provider chain so custom types can be instantiated by name
      from XAML markup.
- [ ] Make Windows App SDK initialization idempotent and version-aware.
- [ ] Auto-discover or explicitly provision the bootstrap DLL.
- [x] Expose the selected framework `resources.pri` path.
- [x] Add Python-specific implicit XAML metadata provider generation.
- [x] Generate the specialized `Application.create_with_metadata_provider()`
      and Fluent-resource bootstrap helpers with matching `.pyi` declarations.
- [x] Run `Application.start`, `Application`, `Window`, `Grid`, `Button`, and
      `TextBlock` on an STA in a live x64 WinUI E2E.
- [x] Validate worker-thread and `asyncio` scheduling while the WinUI
      DispatcherQueue owns the UI thread, including a WinRT async completion
      and `try_enqueue` back to the UI thread.
- [x] Add projected lifetime scopes that release UI/COM wrappers before
      apartment teardown.
- [x] Add awaitable DispatcherQueue result/error/priority scheduling helpers.
- [x] Project `IObservableVector<T>` as a mutable Python sequence with typed
      `VectorChanged` events.
- [x] Add a GIL-safe Python `IElementFactory` bridge and live ItemsRepeater
      get/recycle identity coverage.
- [x] Load and validate Fluent Light, Dark, and High Contrast resources.
- [x] Add a real Python WinUI application E2E on x64.
- [ ] Add Python WinUI application E2E coverage on ARM64.

## Later

- [x] Preserve projected object identity where it affects Python semantics.
- [ ] Support delegates with more than two ABI parameters.
- [ ] Add zero-copy Python buffer protocol integration.
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks against pywinrt for representative APIs.
- [ ] Add diagnostics for active COM wrappers, delegates, and async operations.
