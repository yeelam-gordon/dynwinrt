Benchmark for the full Electron UI call path: **Renderer → IPC → Main Process → native addon → WinRT → IPC → Renderer**.

This demonstrates that **dynwinrt has no meaningful performance impact** in real Electron applications — IPC serialization dominates all native-layer differences.

Environment: AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX, Windows 11, Node.js v22, Electron.

## IPC Baseline

IPC noop round-trip (no WinRT call): **~81 µs**.

## About Measurement Variance

IPC round-trip measurements have significant run-to-run noise caused by V8 JIT/GC, OS scheduling, and IPC serialization jitter. Across multiple runs, the same API can flip direction entirely:

| API | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| `get_Port` → i32 | 0.9x | 1.2x | 1.1x |
| `CombineUri` | 1.0x | 1.0x | 0.9x |
| IPC noop baseline | 82 µs | 114 µs | 81 µs |

Even the IPC baseline varies 81-114 µs between runs depending on system load. This confirms that all differences are noise — the native-layer overhead (1-3 µs for dynwinrt) is far below the IPC noise floor.

## Why It Doesn't Matter

The Electron IPC round-trip costs **~80-114 µs** (varies with system load). The native addon execution is a tiny fraction of that:

```
Electron IPC overhead     ████████████████████████████████████████  ~80-114 µs
dynwinrt invoke overhead  █                                         ~1-3 µs
C++/WinRT invoke          ▏                                         ~0.04-0.9 µs
```

All ratios cluster around **0.9-1.1x** — static and dynamic are indistinguishable through the IPC layer, with variations fully explained by measurement noise.

## Takeaway

For Electron desktop apps, **the choice between static C++/WinRT and dynamic dynwinrt has zero user-visible performance impact**. The IPC boundary is 50-2000x more expensive than any native-layer overhead. This means dynwinrt's benefits — no MSVC compilation, no version-specific generated code, simplified distribution — come at no practical performance cost.
