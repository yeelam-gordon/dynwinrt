## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, 2024 edition)
- **Windows 10/11** with Windows SDK installed
- **Node.js 18+** for the JavaScript binding and generated JavaScript tests
- **CPython 3.11–3.14** plus `maturin` for the Python binding
- **libffi** (bundled via the `libffi` crate)

Some suites also require Windows App SDK metadata/runtime assets or
`Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Win32Metadata`; the test scripts skip optional suites
unless those inputs are explicitly required.

### Building

```bash
# Build the core library
cargo build -p dynwinrt

# Build the code generator
cargo build -p dynwinrt-codegen

# Build the JavaScript binding
(cd bindings/js && npm install && npm run build)

# Build/install the Python binding
(cd bindings/py && python -m maturin develop)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Core library tests
cargo test -p dynwinrt

# Code generator tests
cargo test -p dynwinrt-codegen

# JavaScript tests
(cd bindings/js && npm test)

# Python tests
(cd bindings/py && python -m pytest)

# End-to-end tests (auto-detects available metadata)
pwsh -File ./tests/e2e/e2e_test.ps1
```

### Coverage

Install the Rust coverage tool once:

```powershell
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --version 0.8.7 --locked
```

Run the mixed-language coverage pipeline:

```powershell
.\eng\coverage\coverage.ps1
```

The script builds instrumented Python and Node native modules, runs the
Rust/Python/JavaScript tests and E2E suite, and writes HTML, LCOV, XML, and JSON
reports under `artifacts\coverage`. Default line gates are Rust 45%, Python
70%, and JavaScript 18%; override them with the `-Min*LineCoverage` parameters,
or re-check an existing report tree without rerunning tests via `-ValidateOnly`.

### Code Style

- Run `cargo clippy` before submitting PRs
- Run `cargo fmt --all` to format code; CI enforces `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- Follow standard Rust conventions
