# Python AppLifecycle single instance

This Windows App SDK sample launches two Python processes and demonstrates:

- registering a primary instance with `AppInstance`;
- retrieving the second process's activation arguments;
- redirecting activation asynchronously to the primary process; and
- receiving and unsubscribing from the typed `Activated` event.

## Prerequisites

- `Microsoft.Windows.AppLifecycle.winmd`;
- a newline-separated reference-WinMD list for the matching Windows App SDK;
- the matching architecture's bootstrap DLL;
- `dynwinrt` installed in the selected Python interpreter; and
- `dynwinrt-codegen` on `PATH`, or passed with `-Codegen`.

## Run

```powershell
.\generate.ps1 `
  -AppLifecycleWinmd C:\fixtures\Microsoft.Windows.AppLifecycle.winmd `
  -RefList C:\fixtures\winmd-reference-list.txt `
  -BootstrapDll C:\fixtures\x64\Microsoft.WindowsAppRuntime.Bootstrap.dll `
  -Codegen ..\..\..\target\release\dynwinrt-codegen.exe

.\run.ps1 -Python C:\path\to\python.exe -Major 2 -Minor 3
```

`Major` and `Minor` default to `2` and `3`. They must exactly match the Windows
App SDK product version represented by the metadata, bootstrap DLL, and
installed runtime.

The loopback succeeds only after the secondary process redirects its launch
activation and the primary receives it. It prints `python-app-lifecycle-ok`.
